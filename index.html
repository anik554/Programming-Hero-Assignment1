            Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites
            they need to connect with customers. While businesses could feasibly
            create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress
            templates, these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to
            sites built by professional Web Developers.
